2. How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by anyone) so far? Write the git command you used to get this information.
    - There have been 9 commits.
    - Command: git rev-list --all --count


3. When was the README.md  file modified last? Write the git command you used to get this information
    - The last time the READ.md file was modified last was Thu. Oct. 16 14:00:50 2025 -0500
    - Command: git log -1 --format=%cd -- README.md

4. Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository
    - They let developers work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.
    - They make it easy to merge and test changes separately before adding them to the main branch.

5. What is the difference between git log and git status?
    - git log shows the commit history (who made changes and when).
    - git status shows the current state of your working directory (what files are modified, staged, or committed).

6. What command would you use to see the commits where “Vehicle.h” was one of the committed files?
    - git log --oneline --follow -- Vehicle.h

7. What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word “file”?
    - git log --oneline --grep="file"

8. In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation?
    - Inheritance: When one class gets features or methods from another class.
    - Polymorphism: The ability for different classes to use the same method name but behave differently.
    - Encapsulation: Hiding internal details of a class and only exposing necessary parts through public methods.

9. What is the main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow?
    - Dictator and Lieutenants: One main person (the dictator) controls the final repository, while lieutenants manage sections and send updates upward.
    - Integration Manager: One central person manages merges and integrations, but there’s no strict hierarchy like in the dictator model.

10. How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow?
    - It scales better because work is divided. Lieutenants can review and combine changes from smaller groups before sending them to the main repository, reducing chaos and merge conflicts.
